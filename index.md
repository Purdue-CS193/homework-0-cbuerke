## Cameron's First CS193 Homework
Some of my favorite things about CS193:
- I already enjoy how quickly we have gone through setting up a website.
- The course leads seem compitent and nice, so that's pretty cool.
- I don't feel like this class is a waste of time, which can't be said about _many_ other classes I've taken.
